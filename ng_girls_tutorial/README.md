### Introduction
We'll need a browser to see the result, NodeJS to run scripts on our computer, and NPM to easily fetch libraries from the web. With NPM we'll install the Angular CLI, which will run a script with NodeJS to create a starter project for us, and use NPM to fetch the libraries we'll need for the project (such as Angular)
